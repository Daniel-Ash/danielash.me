        <p> Hey! I'm Dan, a tech professional from New Zealand who is based in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p> I have run product at several very early stage (less than 10 people, pre product-market fit) startups.
          Beyond that I have a background in Data Science & Machine Learning, and was previously a Data Analyst at New
          Zealand's largest online school. </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am endlessly curious, and explore many subjects in my spare time - although they mostly seem to converge
          around tech. </p>
        <p> Although I am unlikely to update this frequently, recent examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt's blog</a>. Especially his posts on how he's built various services like Password Purgatory and Pwned Passwords. Those posts are what led me to deploy this site via Cloudflare pages.</li>
          <li> Distributed systems. In particular, I have been enjoying this <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB"> lecture series by Martin Kleppmann.</a> </li>
          <li> Colour theory, including the physics of colour. <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=7fLV5ezO64w">Check out this video by Marco Bucci</a>.</li>

              <p><a href="https://rgdsm.wordpress.com/">Don McDonald</a> is an eccentric Wellingtonian who proliferates
                marginally coherent content seemingly ad hoc
                through a variety of local and digital media, including <a

              <p>This Node.js project leveraged the Twitter & Open AI API's to generate and post similar tweets to Don
                MacDonald at a random cadence. </p>

            <h4>Key learnings:</h4>
            <ul>
              <li> This was a fun project that got my head around Node & Express. In playing around, I made some fun
                requests that summarised the tweets of an account, and I was interested in extending this to a service
                that allowed any user to use the APIs to summarise a twitter users tweets, generate tweets, and post on
                a
                users behalf.</li>
              <li>Error handling. I wrote this without considering the unexpected, which meant the code broke and was
                also
                very difficult to debug. If I was to return to the project this would be a key objective. </li>
              <li>I would improve my approach to scheduling. I decided it was uncool for a twitter bot to post
                at the same time, every day or every hour, etc. <br>
                <ul>
                  <li>
                    To resolve this, I built a function that
                    would post a tweet
                    and then schedule the next tweet at a random
                    point in future. This was prone to issues because it held
                    the
                    time for the next tweet in memory.
                  </li>
                  <li>If the program crashed or restarted this datapoint was
                    lost. I was running this on replit, which it turns out will frequently restart your process, so in
                    reality this function was never able to post tweets.
                  </li>
                  <li>
                    In future I would look to either: frequently ask a probability function whether to post rather than
                    storing a value in memory, or store the datapoint somewhere more durable.
                  </li>
                </ul>
              </li>
              <li>
                To be honest, this could be reduced to a much simpler cloud function that is scheduled, runs a
                probability
                function (with some parameter to acheive the desired cadence of tweets) that if unsuccessful returns
                immediately, and otherwise runs the logic to generate and post a
                tweet.
              </li>
