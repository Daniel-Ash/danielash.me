        <h2>About me</h2>
        <p> Hey! I'm Dan, a tech professional from New Zealand who is based in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p> I have run product at several very early stage (less than 10 people, pre product-market fit) startups.
          Beyond that I have a background in Data Science & Machine Learning, and was previously a Data Analyst at New
          Zealand's largest online school. </p>
      </div>
      <div class="section">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am endlessly curious, and explore many subjects in my spare time - although they all seem to converge
          around tech. </p>
        <p> Although I am unlikely to update this frequently, recent examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Distributed systems </li>
          <li> Colour theory, including the physics of colour </li>
          <li> Distributed systems </li>

          <h3> Don McNewt </h3>
          <p>Don McDonald is an eccentric Wellingtonian who proliferates marginally coherent content seemingly ad hoc
            through a variety of local and digital media, including Twitter. </p>
          <p>This Node.js project leveraged the Twitter & Open AI API's to generate and post similar tweets to Don
            MacDonald at a random cadence. </p>
          <button id="btn"></button>
          <div class="hidden">
            <p>This was a fun project that got my head around Node & Express. In playing around, I made some fun requests
              that summarised the tweets of an account, and I was interested in extending this to a service that allowed
              any user to use the APIs to summarise a twitter users tweets, generate tweets, and post on a users behalf.
            </p>
            <p>Key learnings:</p>
            <ul>
              <li>Error handling. I wrote this without considering the unexpected, which meant the code broke and was also
                very difficult to debug. If I was to return to the project this would be a key objective </li>
              <li>More issue management. With help from a good friend Schalk, I built a function that would post a tweet
                and then schedule the next tweet at a random point in future. This was prone to issues. The next point was
                held in memory, and was lost if the program crashed or was restarted. This meant that it was extremely
                unlikely that a tweet would ever be posted.

                In future I would look to either: use a probability function that determined whether to post rather than
                storing a value, or store the datapoint somewhere more reliable.
