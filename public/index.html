        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p> I have run product at several very early stage (less than 10 people, pre product-market fit) startups.
          Beyond that I have a background in Data Science & Machine Learning from my time as a Data Analyst at New
          Zealand's largest online school. </p>

        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am endlessly curious, and explore many subjects in my spare time - although they mostly seem to converge
          around tech. </p>
        <p> Although I am unlikely to update this frequently, recent examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> <a href="https://www.troyhunt.com/">Troy Hunt's blog</a>. Especially his posts on how he's built various
            services like Password Purgatory and Pwned Passwords. Those posts are what led me to deploy this site via
            Cloudflare pages.</li>
          <li> Distributed systems. In particular, I have been enjoying this <a
              href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLeKd45zvjcDFUEv_ohr_HdUFe97RItdiB"> lecture series by Martin

            <p> In this lockdown project I used the prompt of a digital art gallery to explore Vue.js. </p>
            <p>Prior to being
              introduced to Vue my programming experience was entirely centered around data analysis - SQL and Jupyter
              Notebooks. My mind had been blown by the Vue 'get started' guide and I was very keen to build a proper
              app.</p>

          <h4>Key learnings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> Building a Vue site with Vite was awesome. I did find there was a pretty steep learning curve to
              implement passing props between components, but I got there. I also found </li>
            <li> This project also helped me to get the hang of modern CSS. I was watching a number of <a
                href="https://www.youtube.com/kepowob">Kevin Powell videos</a> at the time, and was inspired by his
              approach to responsive css, for example: allowing elements to breathe and fill space. Resize the page and
              watch the headers grow/shrink to see this in action. The layout
              also switches orientation based on flex-overflow rather than via a breakpoint.
            </li>
            <li>Although it is not currently available, I also used this project to explore and implement firebase auth,
              which also saw me using things like the Vue router.
              I had an
              idea of introducing user generated content of some description, but that is for another lockdown.. </li>

            <p> Well, you're looking at it. My goal with this site was to make a good looking portfolio page. At the
              same time, I wanted to explore building a site with no framework to feel around the limits of vanilla
              html/css/js.</p>
            <p> I also wanted to focus on performance and accessibility, and to deploy a site using Cloudflare Pages.

          <h4>Key learnings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li>The sorts of limitations I found: </li>
            <ul>
              <li>As my project grew, I was pretty surprised that there wasn't an obvious/simple way to import slabs of
                static html into my index.html just to clean up the codebase. I entered the rabbithole of web components
                but that seemed too complicated for what should be very simple.</li>
              <li>Simultaneously, I have decided not to have show/hide sections, or separate pages simply because it
                seems overkill to implement the js required when I could reach for a framework. The result - a very long
                page. I'm probably ready for a framework.. </li>
              <li>I talk more about it below, but it is nice to have a framework automatically cache bust when static
                content changes.</li>
            </ul>
            <li>Cloudflare Pages is a delight to use. Awesome to simply push to github and have your site available in
              data
              centres around the world, for free.</li>
            <li>It has been awesome to learn more about caches and CDNs. However, I'm not
              totally happy with my current approach to cache busting (manually updating query params on static files),
              and because I don't have a build step (no framework, Cloudflare Pages simply grabs my static files), I am
              not yet sure how I should automatically version static files.. </li>
            <li>I went through a lengthy design phase before I have landed on this very simple single column design. The
              key lesson here is to do as much prototyping in figma as possible. Starting and abandoning half completed
              html/css is painful and time consuming. </li>
            <li>Similarly sometimes you stumble upon the need for a new component while you're cutting some peripheral
              html/css - I think the right call here is to stop and prototype in figma, because the time taken in code
              kills a lot of opportunity for creative destruction.</li>

            <h3> Don McNewt </h3>
            <p><a href="https://rgdsm.wordpress.com/">Don McDonald</a> is an eccentric Wellingtonian who proliferates
              marginally coherent content seemingly ad hoc
              through a variety of local and digital media, including <a
                href="https://twitter.com/McDONewt">Twitter</a>.
            </p>
            <p>This Node.js project leveraged the Twitter & Open AI API's to generate and post similar tweets to Don
              MacDonald at a random cadence. </p>

          <h4>Key learnings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> This was a fun project that got my head around Node & Express. In playing around, I made some fun
              requests that summarised the tweets of an account, and I was interested in extending this to a service
              that allowed any user to use the APIs to summarise a twitter users tweets, generate tweets, and post on
              a
              users behalf.</li>
            <li>Error handling. I wrote this without considering the unexpected, which meant the code broke and was
              also
              very difficult to debug. If I was to return to the project this would be a key objective. </li>
            <li>I would improve my approach to scheduling. I decided it was uncool for a twitter bot to post
              at the same time, every day or every hour, etc. <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To resolve this, I built a function that
                  would post a tweet
                  and then schedule the next tweet at a random
                  point in future. This was prone to issues because it held
                  the
                  time for the next tweet in memory.
                </li>
                <li>If the program crashed or restarted this datapoint was
                  lost. I was running this on replit, which it turns out will frequently restart your process, so in
                  reality this function was never able to post tweets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In future I would look to either: frequently ask a probability function whether to post rather than
                  storing a value in memory, or store the datapoint somewhere more durable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              To be honest, this could be reduced to a much simpler cloud function that is scheduled, runs a
              probability
              function (with some parameter to acheive the desired cadence of tweets) that if unsuccessful returns
              immediately, and otherwise runs the logic to generate and post a
              tweet.
