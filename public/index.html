        <p> Hey! I'm Dan, a tech professional from New Zealand who is based in the United Kingdom.</p>

        <h2>Work</h2>
        <p> I have run product at several very early stage (less than 10 people, pre product-market fit) startups.
          Beyond that I have a background in Data Science & Machine Learning, and was previously a Data Analyst at New
          Zealand's largest online school. </p>

      <div class="section">
        <h2>Interests</h2>
        <p> I am endlessly curious, and explore many subjects in my spare time - although they all seem to converge
          around tech. </p>
        <p> Although I am unlikely to update this frequently, recent examples include:</p>
        <ul>
          <li> Distributed systems </li>
          <li> Colour theory, including the physics of colour </li>

          <p><a href="https://rgdsm.wordpress.com/">Don McDonald</a> is an eccentric Wellingtonian who proliferates
            marginally coherent content seemingly ad hoc
            through a variety of local and digital media, including <a href="https://twitter.com/McDONewt">Twitter</a>.
          </p>
          <p>This Node.js project leveraged the Twitter & Open AI API's to generate and post similar tweets to Don
            MacDonald at a random cadence. </p>

          <h4>Key learnings:</h4>
          <ul>
            <li> This was a fun project that got my head around Node & Express. In playing around, I made some fun
              requests that summarised the tweets of an account, and I was interested in extending this to a service
              that allowed any user to use the APIs to summarise a twitter users tweets, generate tweets, and post on
              a
              users behalf.</li>
            <li>Error handling. I wrote this without considering the unexpected, which meant the code broke and was
              also
              very difficult to debug. If I was to return to the project this would be a key objective. </li>
            <li>I would improve my approach to scheduling. I decided it was uncool for a twitter bot to post
              at the same time, every day or every hour, etc. <br>
              <ul>
                <li>
                  To resolve this, I built a function that
                  would post a tweet
                  and then schedule the next tweet at a random
                  point in future. This was prone to issues because it held
                  the
                  time for the next tweet in memory.
                </li>
                <li>If the program crashed or restarted this datapoint was
                  lost. I was running this on replit, which it turns out will frequently restart your process, so in
                  reality this function was never able to post tweets.
                </li>
                <li>
                  In future I would look to either: frequently ask a probability function whether to post rather than
                  storing a value in memory, or store the datapoint somewhere more durable.
                </li>
              </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
              To be honest, this could be reduced to a much simpler cloud function that is scheduled, runs a
              probability
              function (with some parameter to acheive the desired cadence of tweets) that if unsuccessful returns
              immediately, and otherwise runs the logic to generate and post a
              tweet.
            </li>
          </ul>
